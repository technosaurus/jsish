<title>C-API: Trees</title>

The underlying data structure of objects in JSI is a tree Red-Black trees with invariant node
pointers: nodes are allocated using a single malloc, including space for the key.
This introduces a problem in that varying string keys can not be copied between nodes,
which is required when rebalancing the tree. Although tree supports swapping node positions
instead of keys, objects instead use a key of type STRINGPTR, a combination Hash table and and Tree,
which is fairly efficient because objects often share keys.
