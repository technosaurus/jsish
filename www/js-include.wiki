<title>include</title>
Jsi allows including files of javascript inline, eg.

    <pre class=verbatim>
var x = 1;
include('dir/foo.js');
foo(x);
</pre>

During the evaluation of the include, the current include directory is temporarily changed to that 
of the include files path. The include file may also include other files, up to a  
maximum of 100 (configurable).

Include may also be given an array of files, as in:

    <nowiki><pre class=verbatim>
include(['foo.js','bar.js']);
</nowiki></pre>

NOTE: An optional second argument is ignored as reserved for possible future options.
