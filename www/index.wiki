</font>
</p>

provides built-in support for [./js-sqlite.wiki|Sqlite], [./js-websocket.wiki|WebSockets],
[./js-json.wiki|JSON] and a [./js-zvfs.wiki|Zip filesystem].
It is used for creating [./zeroinstall.wiki|standalone] desktop web-database applications
or for embedding in other applications.

<h4>Example Applications</h4>

The Jsi distribution comes with several demo applications designed to
showcase it's power and functionality:

  *  [app/sqliteui.wiki|SqliteUI]: a user interface to Sqlite. 
  *  [app/ledgerjs.wiki|LedgerJS]: an accounting program.

<h4>Rationale</h4>

For desktop web-application development, there many alternatives
but none of these
deliver the range of functionality in Jsi, with anything approching it's small form-factor.

For a description of the rationale
behind Jsi, including comparisons against alternatives such as
NodeJs, Lua, Tcl and LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySql/PHP),
