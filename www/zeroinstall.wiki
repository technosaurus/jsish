<title>Zero Install</title>
Zero Install refers to using Jsi to deploy a standalone application in a self contained executable.
Simply this uses [./js-zvfs.wiki|Zvfs] to wrap scripts, web pages, images, etc all into
a zip archive appended to the end of the jsish binary.

And because Jsi provides the web server, browser interface, database, and scripting environment,
a full featured, standalone applications can be implemented without low level coding.

On the other hand, if you need the speed of C, Jsi facilitates writing extensions which can easily
be incorporated into jsish, or Jsi linked into your own application.
