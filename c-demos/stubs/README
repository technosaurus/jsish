This example demonstrates stub extensions.
Stubs allows dynamic loading of extensions into static binaries.
Jsi comes with stub support builtin by compiling with -DJSI_USE_STUBS.

Moreover, extensions themselves can be stubbified, as we demostrate.
The "demo" extension is loaded first. It provides a JS command "demo()",
and 2 C functions Demo_Incr and Demo_Decr.

The second extension "user" is then loaded.  It uses stub support 
provided by "demo" to access it's C code Demo_Incr and Demo_Decr.

The file demoStubs.h is generated from demo.h using tools/mkstubs.js.
To understand this note in demo.h the comments /*STUB = 1*/ etc.
These indicate slots in the stub table: these should never be change.
New functions can be added, but old ones may not be changed.
